**Self-set rules:**
- Human coded, AI reviewed.
- Avoid looking at Annotated Transformer. Let my brain do the work.
- Avoid using 3P deps other than numpy.
- Use types

**Goals**
- Develop a deep understanding of the original transformer.
- Build strong intuition for training attention-based neural networks.
